In this course we will examine the development of the novel from its origin in a multiplicity of diverse literary genres in the eighteenth century to its Victorian incarnation as a “realist” and middle-class form. We will then go on to examine the appropriation of the novel as high art by Modernist writers and its subsequent return to its multi-genre roots later in the twentieth century. We will trace changes in the novel’s treatment of themes such as publicity and privacy, the role of gender and sexuality in social life, the significance of monetary exchange, and the proper relation between the author and his or her text. We will pay close attention to questions of realism, and will think about how the novel’s form and content work together to create literary meaning.  First surveying the main critical narratives of the novel's "rise" or development, we will move on to see how the concept of advertising – including advertisements for novels and representations of advertising within novels - might offer us a counter-narrative to more conventional interpretations of the novel and its origins. We will also spend time examining the material forms of some novels and will learn about how they were published and circulated. And – in a small experimental unit – we will use Roland Barthes’ The Preparation of the Novel as a jumping-off point for thinking about what it means to prepare to research and write a novel.

These books are available at the Swarthmore bookstore. You are also welcome to buy these books online or at a different store. Be aware that you need to have your own copy of the specific edition of each of the books listed above. Sadly, ebook readers are not yet robust enough for the lightening-fast page-turning and passage-navigating we will be doing in the class, so they are not an alternative to printing pdfs. I do recommend that you print on both sides and, if your eyesight is up to it, two pages per side. 

Course texts: criticism
Benedict Anderson, from Imagined Communities 
Nancy Armstrong, from Desire and Domestic Fiction 
Roland Barthes, "The Reality Effect" 
Michel Foucault, "Panopticism" from Discipline and Punish
Catherine Gallagher, "The Rise of Fictionality" 
Jürgen Habermas, from The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere
Henry James, "The Art of Fiction"
Fredric Jameson, “The Realist Floor-plan” 
George Levine, from The Realistic Imagination
Michael McKeon, "Generic Transformation and Social Change: Rethinking the Rise of the Novel"
D.A. Miller, from The Novel and the Police 
Ian Watt, from The Rise of the Novel

All of the critical readings will be available in pdf form in our Dropbox. I will be inviting you to the Dropbox shortly; if you prefer to use an email addresses other than your Swarthmore one, make sure you let me know. 

*Please be sure to print out the pdf format texts and bring them to class with you on the relevant days.*

Additional reading
While it is in no way necessary for you to read ANY of these additional texts (except potentially during preparation for your final paper), in the “extra reading” course documents folder you will find some lists of texts should you wish to do more reading on a particular novel, or on the history of theory of the novel more generally. You should also feel free to consult me about what additional reading might best fit your interests. 

Reading assignments
Because novels are, almost by definition, long, some of our reading assignments will necessary be lengthy.  Weekly reading assignments will generally be between 150 and (much less often) 250 pages of novel and five to twenty pages of secondary reading. I recommend that you look at the syllabus and plan to start reading longer assignments ahead of time. There may be occasional reading quizzes – covering both novels and critical/theoretical readings - as necessary. 

Informal reading responses
Each of you will be assigned to a reading-response group. Four times during the semester, I will ask you to write a short post (about 250 words) in response to the week’s reading and post it to our class blog by Sunday night. You will usually get to choose your topic. Use this opportunity to think about something in the text that interested, puzzled, or surprised you, or to think about some specific aspect of the text you found difficult. Occasionally I will assign a question to which the postings should respond. Eight times during the semester, during the two weeks following your blog week, I will ask you to comment substantially on one of your classmate’s blog posts. Example: I’m in group 1. I blog for week III; I then respond to at least one other person’s post during both weeks IV and V. I’m off during week VI (and week VII because of October break); it week VIII it is my turn to blog again. Blog responses are due by Monday night. They are assessed as part of your participation grade. Anytime you would like to check in with me about your blog progress, you may bring out copies of your posts and comments and bring them to my office hours to discuss them with me. 

Short paper
This is a 4-5 page paper. It should make an argument based on close readings of one of the novels.You may want to set up a conference with me to discuss the paper beforehand, but this is optional.

Research project
The research project designed to acquaint you with bibliographic description and ask you to think about other possible ways of describing or representing an eighteenth-century book; we will discuss specifics in class.  It is a public assignment, which means that you should know and agree that it will be published on a website accessible to the general public. I will discuss this more in class.  

Final paper or project
This assignment will incorporate secondary sources and some independent research (specifics of the assignment to be discussed further in class).  

Criticism exam
This 50-minute exam is designed to text your knowledge of the critical and theoretical readings. We will devote a day to reviewing for it at the end of the semester. I will be very clear about the exam’s format and contents.

Weekly class format
Though this will certainly vary as needed, in general our Mondays will be dedicated to some overview of major questions and issues along with contextualization and background, often partially in the form of lecture but including discussion. Wednesdays we will tend to delve into particular passages in more depth, and Fridays we will discuss critical readings together (sometimes in smaller groups at first) before coming to a modicum of closure via those critical readings and briefly setting up for the following week. 


Policies and Advice

Grading
20% class participation (includes quizzes and blog posts)
20% 4-5 page paper 
20% research project
10% criticism exam
30% 10-12 page final paper or project

Laptops and phones
This policy is constantly in flux for me, but this year in this class I am going to ask that you do not use a laptop, tablet, or phone for note-taking (or anything else) during class time. We may change this policy over the course of the semester. I’ll also ask that you silence and put away your mobile phone for the duration of class. Disability accommodations requiring the use of a computer are not covered by this policy. 

Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offence. It includes both the direct copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. See the English department’s guidelines on how to properly cite sources here:
http://www.swarthmore.edu/x10027.xml 
If you have any questions about how to properly cite another person’s work, please do not hesitate to ask me.

Attendance and due dates 
Because this is a discussion-oriented class, attendance is essential. Missing more than three class sessions will result in a lowered grade (1/3 of a grade per additional unexcused absence) unless you have a valid excuse confirmed by your advisor or class dean. (Remember to reserve some of your absences for the possibility of missing class due to routine illness like the flu or a bad cold.) Late papers will incur a penalty (1/3 of a grade per class day late) unless you have a similarly valid excuse. So if a paper is due on Friday and you don’t turn it in until Wednesday, that’s 2/3 of a grade late, making an actual B+ paper, for example, into a recorded B-. 

Pre- and post-1830 Requirement
This class may count towards either the pre-1830 or the post-1830 requirement.  

### Accommodations for disability
I want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn most effectively. You are always free to talk to me about your own situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here: If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact Leslie Hempling in the Office of Student Disability Services (Parrish 113) or email lhempli1@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, she will issue students with documented disabilities a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact her as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations process, visit the Student Disability Service Website at http://www.swarthmore.edu/academic-advising-support/welcome-to-student-disability-service.  You are also welcome to contact me [the faculty member] privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged through the Office of Student Disability Services.
